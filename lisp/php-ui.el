;;; Commentary:

;; PHP Mode integrates LSP Mode (lsp-ui), Phpactor (phpactor.el) and IDE-like tools.

;;; Code:
(eval-when-compile
  (require 'php-ui-phpactor))

(defvar php-ui-feature-alist
  '((phpactor :test (lambda () (and (require 'phpactor nil t) (featurep 'phpactor)))
              :activate php-ui-phpactor-activate
              :deactivate php-ui-phpactor-activate)
    (lsp-mode :test (lambda () (and (require 'lsp nil t) (featurep 'lsp)))
              :activate lsp
              :deactivate lsp-workspace-shutdown)))

(defvar php-ui-impl nil)

;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode php-ui-mode
  "Minor mode for integrate IDE-like tools."
  :tag "PHP-UI"
  (let ((ui-plist (cdr-safe (assq 'phpactor php-ui-feature-alist))))
    (if php-ui-mode
        (php-ui--activate-buffer ui-plist)
      (php-ui--deactivate-buffer ui-plist))))

(defun php-ui--activate-buffer (ui-plist)
